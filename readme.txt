See the full list of features [here](https://www.restaumatic.com/).

Important: for this plugin to work, you must sign up for your own [Active Menu on Restaumatic.com](https://www.restaumatic.com/en/ordering-system/) and then include it on your website using the shortcode provided by this plugin.

= Usage =

First go to the WordPress admin area > WP Restaumatic settings page and configure your Active Menu slug. Then put the shortcode in the page content and publish the page.

* `[restaumatic_active_menu]` Basic usage (display restaurant select page in case of many restaurants or menu page if you have one restaurant).
* `[restaumatic_active_menu restaurant="active-menu"]` Define specific menu to display (if you have more than one restaurant).
* `[restaumatic_active_menu slug="active-menu"]` Specify the Active Menu slug directly in the shortcode.

Please keep in mind that only one instance of the shortcode is supported on the same page. If you have more than one restaurant, use separate pages for each menu or include all menus at once using restaurant select page as shown in the examples above.

= Shortcode options =

* **slug** The Active Menu slug. Optional if you have provided the slug on WP Restaumatic settings page.
* **restaurant** (optional) Specify the restaurant menu to display. Useful if you have more than one restaurant and you want to display specific menu instead of the restaurant select page.
